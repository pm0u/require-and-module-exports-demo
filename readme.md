##Instructions

- Run npm install
- Utilize npm test to check if you have correctly exported and imported from both files.

- All of the functions in functions.js are written correctly.
- However, main.js is attempting to use these functions.
- Start by exporting the functions in the functions.js file.
- Then, import these functions into main.js.
- TIP: Given that the functions are referenced only by their name as written in functions.js, you will need to use object destructuring when you import these functions.
- The tests will pass when you have correctly exported and imported.
